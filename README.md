# Android Developer Roadmap

## Resources 

### Books

#### Android specific

- [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/)

### Project Guidelines & conventions

- [Project and Code Guidelines by ribot](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/project_and_code_guidelines.md)

- [A successful XML naming convention](https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2016/03/07/resourcenaming/)
Notes: I am not so agree in some conventions used in the article.

   - I don't see the point to use "all" as part of the main. For
me does not include more helpful  information. If the resource
is used 1 or 50 times should not makes any differences in the naming.

   - As part of the adoption of "Project and Code Guidelines by ribot"
I like to use <WHAT> part in resources like drawables. The reason is
because the IDE order the folder by the name and apart to give more
clarity, all the drawable would be ordered by type.
